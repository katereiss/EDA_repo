The goal of this project is to find the specific places in the NYC area that my client, street performer and violinist Karolina Protsenko, should perform in order to maximize the amount of foot traffic that would see their performances. I use the last three months of available MTA turnstile data in order to determine the stations and times of day with the most people entering and exiting.

The figure depicts the ten Metropolitan Transportation Authority stations with the highest average daily entries and exits. 34th Street/Penn Station has the most total traffic, and further analysis will indicate what days and times of day have the most total traffic.

Additional data to include would be pedestrian-only streets mapped comparatively with these above stations, as pedestrian-only streets closest to stations with the most traffic would be my recommendation for my client.
